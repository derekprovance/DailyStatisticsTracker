# DailyStatisticsTracker
JavaFX program that tracks the user's daily statistics for later analyzation. 

This project was largely inspired by Steve Job's quote
<blockquote>I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</blockquote>

<h3>Project Purpose</h3>
